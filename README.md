# Reminder App

This repository contains a simplified Flutter application skeleton for a persistent reminder system. The app demonstrates:

- Task management with subtasks
- Persistent urgency settings (Normal, Urgent, Super Important)
- Firestore integration for syncing tasks
- Local notifications scheduled through background services
- Editable reminder frequencies in a settings screen

The project is structured for future expansion with features like image or voice note attachments and desktop support.
